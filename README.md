# ESCI-JS

This is a JavaScript implementation of Geoff Cumming and Robert Calin-Jageman's ESCI software as provided with the book: Introduction to the New Statistics.

It is still in development. It could be better refactored, but hey, we do the best we can with the time available!

It uses D3 for some aspects, jQuery, jStat and at times just plain old JavaScript which reaches the parts other libraries cannot ;)
