#ESCI-JS

This is a JavaScript implementation of Geoff Cummings and Robert Calin-Jageman's ESCI software as provided with the (Introduction to the) New Statistics book.

It is still in development. It could be better refactored, but hey, we do the best we can with the time available!

It uses D3 for some aspects, jQuery, jStat and at times just plain old JavaScript which reaches the parts other libraries cannot ;)
